# JupyterLab + Binder

[![Binder](http://mybinder.org/badge.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/richard-miller/jupyterlab/master?urlpath=lab/tree/index.ipynb)

JupyterLab is packaged with Binder repositories by default. In order to
run a JupyterLab session, you have two options:

## Start JupyterLab after you start your Binder

Do the following:

1. Launch a Binder instance (e.g., by clicking the Binder badge)
2. Replace `tree` at the end of your URL with `lab`.
3. That's it!
